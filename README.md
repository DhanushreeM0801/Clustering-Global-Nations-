# üåç Unsupervised Learning for Country Classification ‚Äì HELP International

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to assist **HELP International**, a global humanitarian NGO, in identifying countries most in need of aid based on socio-economic and health indicators. The organization raised **$10 million** to support underprivileged nations, and this project provides a data-driven strategy to allocate those funds effectively.

## üìå Project Objective

- Cluster countries based on indicators such as GDP per capita, healthcare access, child mortality, life expectancy, and other socio-economic metrics.
- Provide HELP International with a **framework to prioritize** aid distribution based on real data.
- Promote **data-driven decision-making** in humanitarian aid using unsupervised learning methods.

## üîç Problem Statement

HELP International faces a challenge: how to **strategically allocate limited resources** ($10M) to the most vulnerable nations. The diversity and complexity of socio-economic data across countries make manual assessment inefficient and potentially biased.

This project solves that problem by:
- **Analyzing multidimensional data**
- Using **unsupervised clustering algorithms**
- Visualizing groupings of countries by development level

## üß† Algorithms Used

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction to improve clustering performance.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Efficient partitioning of countries into meaningful groups.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: To understand nested similarities between nations.

## üìä Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- [World Bank & WHO](https://data.worldbank.org/) for socio-economic indicators

## üß© Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Global socio-economic and health datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Correlation matrix, distribution plots.
4. **PCA Application**: Reduce feature dimensions while retaining variance.
5. **Clustering**: Apply K-Means and evaluate with silhouette score & elbow method.
6. **Visualization**: Scatter plots, cluster maps, dendrograms.
7. **Insights**: Recommend cluster groups for focused intervention.

## üìà FINAL PREDICTION

- Guide effective aid allocation using predictive modeling based on socio-economic & health indicators.
- Predictive classification identifies Class 1 countries as top priority ‚Äî facing highest child mortality, 	low GDP,    high inflation.
- Aims to provide immediate relief and build long-term sustainable solutions.
- Supports data-driven decisions that go beyond surface-level observations.
- Continuous monitoring & data updates to adapt to changing needs.
- Local stakeholder engagement ensures culturally relevant, community-supported interventions.
- Promotes agility & responsiveness in humanitarian action.

## üí° Key Benefits

- Eliminates subjectivity in aid decisions.
- Identifies **hidden patterns** in global development data.
- Ensures **equitable and ethical** resource allocation.
- Enhances organizational **transparency and accountability**.
